# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass helps customers study and pass DMV driving tests. The system takes reservations and provides online training course content for customers who have certain packages.
# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well with identifying requirements for this project.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my diagrams for the system designs documents to better reflect the use cases I chose. I would improve it by revising the login process to better reflect security protocol.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the interview documentation provided to interpret and implement user needs. It's important to consider user needs because the end goal is to create a product the client is satisfied with. 
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by thoroughly researching and learning about the requirements for the project. In the future, I will use the uml diagrams I learned about in this class to plan when I design.
